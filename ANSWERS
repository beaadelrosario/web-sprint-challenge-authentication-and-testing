1. Differences between using sessions or JSON Web Tokens for authentication.

Session cookies only work across a single domain, or on its subdomains. ... With JSON web tokens, you can authenticate a user across multiple locations including multiple domains, mobile devices, and APIs to name a few. This is because they're stored locally in the request header.

2. What does bcrypt do to help us store passwords in a secure manner.

- password hashing function.
- implements salting both manually and automatically.
- accumulative hashing rounds.
- Having an algorithm that hashes the information multiple times (rounds) means an attacker needs to have the hash, know the algorithm used, and how many rounds were used to generate the hash in the first place.

3. How are unit tests different from integration and end-to-end testing.

Unlike end-to-end tests that rely on external components, unit tests are not flaky. ... They have one major advantage over unit tests: they ensure that modules which work well in isolation, also play well together. Integration tests typically focus on a small number of modules and test their interactions.

4. How Test Driven Development changes the way we write applications and tests.

Test driven development is the process of writing tests before code. In theory, when you start with the end (the tests) in mind, you can write much higher quality code. You might be familiar with similar philosophies in teaching (backwards planning)
